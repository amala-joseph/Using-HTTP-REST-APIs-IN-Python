# Using-HTTP-REST-APIs-IN-Python
This project is made for the understanding and implementation of HTTP and REST API in PYTHON. The HTTP protocol allows to send and receive information through the web including webpages, images, and other web resources. API - Application Programming Interface and is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
## HTTP and REST API in Python
### Purpose
The project utilizes HTTP and REST APIs to enable communication between clients and servers in a standardized way. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of any data exchange on the web, and REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of constraints for creating web services that interact with resources using standard HTTP methods. This project leverages these technologies to provide a seamless and efficient way to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data over the web.

### Description
HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests and information on the internet. It facilitates the sending and receiving of data between clients (such as web browsers or mobile applications) and servers. In this project, HTTP is used to manage the communication between different parts of the system.

REST API is a design pattern for an application programming interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. REST APIs provide a way to interact with web services by using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. They are designed to be stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.

In Python, various libraries and frameworks can be used to create and interact with REST APIs, including:

-**requests**: A simple, yet powerful, HTTP library for making requests and handling responses.

-**Flask**: A micro web framework that can be used to build RESTful services with minimal overhead.

-**Django**: A high-level Python web framework that includes robust support for building RESTful APIs, especially when paired with Django REST Framework (DRF).

-**FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

Key HTTP Methods Used in REST APIs:
-**GET**: Retrieve data from the server.

-**POST**: Send data to the server to create a resource.

-**PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server.

-**DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.

In this project the focus is more cconcentrated to request API.
